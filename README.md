# some advices from my experienced friends for team work on github:

1. "It's advisable to regularly pull to work with the most updated version."

2. "Before committing or pushing, remember to run 'git status' or 'git branch' to ensure that you're on the correct branch. Working on the wrong branch can lead to conflicts."

3. "Once a conflict occurs, it's recommended to Google how to handle it and resolve the conflict through Git rather than handling it manually."
